My notecard sheets focus most on week 8+, starting at bases and going through assembly
I hope to finish other sections on Monday, but I'm not sure if I'll have time. I'll post them here when I do.

Note that these notes are not designed to be studied off of, instead are designed to be the most
compressed version to fit on a quick reference guide

Front Page = Primary, rapid access stuff
Back Page = Secondary, random stuff
