Cannot return arrays, must return pointer
Pass by copy
Strings auto pass as pointers
Identifiers = Structs,Enums (var names)
Static = Global to file
Main structure = int main(int argc, char *argv[]){} - argc = # of args, argv = array of args

dereference/value = *x
address = &x
pointer casting = (int *)x 
To get X bytes of a pointer: *(uintX_t *)p 
    p = pointer, uintX_t = type(uint8_t)
EX: uint64_t = 64 bits = 8 bytes = 16 nibbles


scope = legal to use names
lifetime = time in memory
int x[10]; = 10 ints array
int *x = malloc(10 * sizeof(int )); = dynamic 10 int array
