# Makefiles

It has been confirmed by Professor McPherson himself that sharing a Makefile is not considered a violation of academic integrity.
So, here are a collection of Makefiles that you can drop into your homework and projects
so that you don't have to memorize a lengthy compile command.
These Makefiles also include helpful tasks like packaging and running valgrind.

## Downloading Makefiles
Github is annoying with downloading individual files.
To download the Makefile, first open one of the links above.
Then, click on the button in the top right labeled `Raw`.
This will show the entire file as plaintext in your web browser.
Copy all of this and then paste it into a new file named `Makefile`.
