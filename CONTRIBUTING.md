# Contributing Notes
When contributing your notes, first make sure they are in `.md` files.
If you don't know Markdown, it's easy! Just take a look at
[this handy cheatsheet!](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

Then make sure to put the files in the correct week that they are relevant to.
These folders have the format `week-#`, where `#` is the week number.
You can see which week we're on in Canvas under Pages -> Topics

Make sure your note files have this at the very top and bottom of the file:
```
- [Go back](README.md)
```
This enables some nice navigation for those who are viewing the notes.

Make sure there is a `README.md` file in the `week-#` folder.
This file acts as a "Table of Contents" for the week.
Look at other `README.md` files in the `week-#` folders for
how they are structured.
Ensure this line is at the bottom of the `README.md`:
```
- [Go back](../README.md)
```
This also enables some navigation for those who are viewing the notes.
Notice that this is different from the line used in note files.
