# Contributing Notes
When contributing your notes, first make sure they are in `.md` files.
If you don't know Markdown, it's easy! Just take a look at
[this handy cheatsheet!](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
VS Code can write in Markdown and give you a live preview by clicking on this icon in
the top right:

**Make sure your notes do not violate the honor code. You may share your knowledge, but you
will not share answers to homework, tests, or projects.** This does not mean you cannot
provide notes that can help fellow students figure out answers, but sending in direct answers
will not be tolerated.

Then make sure to put the files in the correct week that they are relevant to.
These folders have the format `week-#`, where `#` is the week number.
You can see which week we're on in Canvas under Pages -> Topics

Make sure your note files have this at the very top and bottom of the file:
```
- [Go back](README.md)
```
This enables some nice navigation for those who are viewing the notes.

Make sure there is a `README.md` file in the `week-#` folder.
This file acts as a "Table of Contents" for the week.
Look at other `README.md` files in the `week-#` folders for
how they are structured.
Ensure this line is at the bottom of the `README.md`:
```
- [Go back](../README.md)
```
This also enables some navigation for those who are viewing the notes.
Notice that this is different from the line used in note files.
